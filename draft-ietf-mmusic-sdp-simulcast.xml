    <abstract>
      <t>In some application scenarios it may be desirable to send multiple
      differently encoded versions of the same media source in different RTP
      streams. This is called simulcast. This document discusses the best way
      of accomplishing simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in SDP. A
      solution is defined by making an extension to SDP, and using RTP/RTCP
      identification methods to relate RTP streams belonging to the same media
      source. The SDP extension consists of a new media level SDP attribute
      that expresses capability to send and/or receive simulcast RTP streams.
      RTP/RTCP identification using either payload types or a separately
      defined method for RTP stream configuration are defined.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Most of today's multiparty video conference solutions make use of
      centralized servers to reduce the bandwidth and CPU consumption in the
      endpoints. Those servers receive RTP streams from each participant and
      send some suitable set of possibly modified RTP streams to the rest of
      the participants, which usually have heterogeneous capabilities (screen
      size, CPU, bandwidth, codec, etc). One of the biggest issues is how to
      perform RTP stream adaptation to different participants' constraints
      with the minimum possible impact on both video quality and server
      performance.</t>

      <t>Simulcast is defined in this memo as the act of simultaneously
      sending multiple different encoded streams of the same media source,
      e.g. the same video source encoded with different video encoder types or
      image resolutions. This can be done in several ways and for different
      purposes. This document focuses on the case where it is desirable to
      provide a media source as multiple encoded streams over <xref
      target="RFC3550">RTP</xref> towards an intermediary so that the
      intermediary can provide the wanted functionality by selecting which RTP
      stream(s) to forward to other participants in the session, and more
      specifically how the identification and grouping of the involved RTP
      streams are done. From an RTP perspective, simulcast is a specific
      application of the aspects discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines">RTP Multiplexing
      Guidelines</xref>.<!--MW: What is referenced in the above sentence by "the aspects discussed"--></t>

      <t>This document describes a few scenarios where it is motivated to use
      simulcast, and also defines the needed SDP signaling for it.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-definitions" title="Definitions">
      <t/>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>This document makes use of the terminology defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy">RTP Taxonomy</xref>,
        <xref target="RFC5117">RTP Topology</xref> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update">RTP Topologies
        Update</xref>. In addition, the following terms are used:<list
            style="hanging">
            <t hangText="RTP Mixer:">An RTP middle node, defined in <xref
            target="RFC5117"/> (Section 3.4: Topo-Mixer), further elaborated
            and extended with other topologies in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update"/> (Section 3.6 to
            3.9).</t>

            <t hangText="RTP Switch:">A common short term for the terms
            "switching RTP mixer", "source projecting middlebox", and "video
            switching MCU" as discussed in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update"/>.</t>

            <t hangText="Simulcast Stream:">One Encoded Stream or Dependent
            Stream from a set of concurrently transmitted Encoded Streams and
            optional Dependent Streams, all sharing a common Media Source, as
            defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy"/>.
            Decoding a Dependent Stream also requires the related (Dependent
            and) Encoded Stream(s), but in the context of simulcast that is
            considered a property of the Dependent Stream constituting the
            simulcast stream. For example, HD and thumbnail video simulcast
            versions of a single Media Source sent concurrently as separate
            RTP Streams.</t>

            <t hangText="Simulcast Format:">Different formats of a simulcast
            stream serve the same purpose as alternative RTP payload types in
            non-simulcast SDP, to allow multiple alternative media formats for
            a given RTP Stream. As for multiple RTP payload types on the
            m-line, any one of the alternative formats can be used at a given
            point in time, but not more than one (based on RTP timestamp), and
            what format is used can change dynamically from one RTP packet to
            another. For example, if all participants in a group video call
            can decode H.264 and H.265 video, but only some can encode H.265,
            both H.264 and H.265 can be kept as alternative formats, and the
            format may dynamically switch between H.264 and H.265 as different
            participants become active speaker.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-use-cases" title="Use Cases">
      <t>Many use cases of simulcast as described in this document relate to a
      multi-party communication session where one or more central nodes are
      used to adapt the view of the communication session towards individual
      participants, and facilitate the media transport between participants.
      Thus, these cases targets the RTP Mixer type of topology.</t>

      <t>There are two principle approaches for an RTP Mixer to provide this
      adapted view of the communication session to each receiving
      participant:<list style="symbols">
          <t>Transcoding (decoding and re-encoding) received RTP streams with
          characteristics adapted to each receiving participant. This often
          include mixing or composition of media sources from multiple
          participants into a mixed media source originated by the RTP Mixer.
          The main advantage of this approach is that it achieves close to
          optimal adaptation to individual receiving participants. The main
          disadvantages are that it can be very computationally expensive to
          the RTP Mixer and typically also degrades media Quality of
          Experience (QoE) such as end-to-end delay for the receiving
          participants.</t>

          <t>Switching a subset of all received RTP streams or sub-streams to
          each receiving participant, where the used subset is typically
          specific to each receiving participant. The main advantages of this
          approach are that it is computationally cheap to the RTP Mixer and
          it has very limited impact on media QoE. The main disadvantage is
          that it can be difficult to combine a subset of received RTP streams
          into a perfect fit to the resource situation of a receiving
          participant.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The use of simulcast relates to the latter approach, where it is more
      important to reduce the load on the RTP Mixer and/or minimize QoE impact
      than to achieve an optimal adaptation of resource usage.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-diverse-receivers"
               title="Reaching a Diverse Set of Receivers">
        <t>The media sources provided by a sending participant potentially
        need to reach several receiving participants that differ in terms of
        available resources. The receiver resources that typically differ
        include, but are not limited to:<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Codec:">This includes codec type (such as SDP MIME
            type) and can include codec configuration options (e.g. SDP fmtp
            parameters). A couple of codec resources that differ only in codec
            configuration will be "different" if they are somehow not
            "compatible", like if they differ in video codec profile, or the
            transport packetization configuration.</t>

            <t hangText="Sampling:">This relates to how the media source is
            sampled, in spatial as well as in temporal domain. For video
            streams, spatial sampling affects image resolution and temporal
            sampling affects video frame rate. For audio, spatial sampling
            relates to the number of audio channels and temporal sampling
            affects audio bandwidth. This may be used to suit different
            rendering capabilities or needs at the receiving endpoints, as
            well as a method to achieve different transport capabilities,
            bitrates and eventually QoE by controlling the amount of source
            data.</t>

            <t hangText="Bitrate:">This relates to the amount of bits spent
            per second to transmit the media source as an RTP stream, which
            typically also affects the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the
            receiving user.</t>
          </list>Letting the sending participant create a simulcast of a few
        differently configured RTP streams per media source can be a good
        tradeoff when using an RTP switch as middlebox, instead of sending a
        single RTP stream and using an RTP mixer to create individual
        transcodings to each receiving participant.</t>

        <t>This requires that the receiving participants can be categorized in
        terms of available resources and that the sending participant can
        choose a matching configuration for a single RTP stream per category
        and media source.</t>

        <t>For example, assume for simplicity a set of receiving participants
        that differ only in that some have support to receive Codec A, and the
        others have support to receive Codec B. Further assume that the
        sending participant can send both Codec A and B. It can then reach all
        receivers by creating two simulcasted RTP streams from each media
        source; one for Codec A and one for Codec B.</t>

        <t>In another simple example, a set of receiving participants differ
        only in screen resolution; some are able to display video with at most
        360p resolution and some support 720p resolution. A sending
        participant can then reach all receivers by creating a simulcast of
        RTP streams with 360p and 720p resolution for each sent video media
        source.</t>

        <t>In more elaborate cases, the receiving participants differ both in
        available sampling and bitrate, and maybe also codec, and it is up to
        the RTP switch to find a good trade-off in which simulcasted stream to
        choose for each intended receiver. It is also the responsibility of
        the RTP switch to negotiate a good fit of simulcast streams with the
        sending participant.</t>

        <t>The maximum number of simulcasted RTP streams that can be sent is
        mainly limited by the amount of processing and uplink network
        resources available to the sending participant.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-application-specific"
               title="Application Specific Media Source Handling">
        <t>The application logic that controls the communication session may
        include special handling of some media sources. It is for example
        commonly the case that the media from a sending participant is not
        sent back to itself.</t>

        <t>It is also common that a currently active speaker participant is
        shown in larger size or higher quality than other participants (the
        sampling or bitrate aspects of <xref
        target="sec-diverse-receivers"/>). Not sending the active speaker
        media back to itself means there is some other participant's media
        that instead has to receive special handling towards the active
        speaker; typically the previous active speaker. This way, the
        previously active speaker is needed both in larger size (to current
        active speaker) and in small size (to the rest of the participants),
        which can be solved with a simulcast from the previously active
        speaker to the RTP switch.</t>

      <section anchor="sec-receiver-preferences"
               title="Receiver Media Source Preferences">
        <t>The application logic that controls the communication session may
        allow receiving participants to apply preferences to the
        characteristics of the RTP stream they receive, for example in terms
        of the aspects listed in <xref target="sec-diverse-receivers"/>.
        Sending a simulcast of RTP streams is one way of accommodating

        by commas). The meaning of the attribute on SDP session level is
        undefined and MUST NOT be used. The <xref target="RFC5234">ABNF</xref>

        <t/>

        <t>There are separate and independent sets of parameters for simulcast
        in send and receive directions. When listing multiple directions, each
        direction MUST NOT occur more than once on the same line.</t>

        <t>Two simulcast stream identification methods are defined; "pt" using
        RTP payload type (SDP format), and "rid" using an additional <xref
        target="I-D.pthatcher-mmusic-rid">RTP-level identification
        mechanism</xref>. Different identification methods MUST NOT be used
        for different directions on a single "a=simulcast" line.
        Implementations that support both identification methods MAY include
        one "a=simulcast" line for each identification method for the same
        "m="-line. Multiple "a=simulcast" lines with the same identification
        method MUST NOT be used for a single "m="-line.</t>

        <t>Attribute parameters are grouped by direction and consist of a
        listing of simulcast stream identifications to be used. The number of
        (non-alternative, see below) identifications in the list sets a limit
        to the number of supported simulcast streams in that direction. The
        order of the listed simulcast versions in the "send" direction
        suggests a proposed order of preference, in decreasing order: the
        stream listed first is the most preferred <xref
        target="sec-diverse-receivers"/>, and subsequent streams have
        progressively lower preference. The order of the listed simulcast
        streams in the "recv" direction expresses a preference which simulcast
        streams that are preferred, with the leftmost being most preferred.
        This can be of importance if the number of actually sent simulcast
        streams have to be reduced for some reason.</t>

        <t>Formats that have explicit <xref
        target="RFC5583">dependencies</xref> <xref
        target="I-D.pthatcher-mmusic-rid"/> to other formats (even in the same
        media description) MAY be listed as different simulcast streams.</t>

        <t>Alternative simulcast formats MAY be specified as part of the
        attribute parameters by expressing each simulcast stream as a
        comma-separated list of alternative format identifiers. In this case,
        there MUST NOT be any capability restriction in what alternative
        formats can be used across different simulcast streams, like requiring
        all simulcast streams to use the same codec format alternative. The
        order of the format alternatives within a simulcast stream is
        significant; the alternatives are listed from (left) most preferred to
        (right) least preferred. For the use of simulcast, this overrides the
        normal codec preference as expressed by format type ordering on the
        "m="-line, using regular SDP rules. This is to enable a separation of
        general codec preferences and simulcast stream configuration
        preferences.</t>

        <t>A simulcast stream can use a codec defined such that the same RTP
        SSRC can change RTP payload type multiple times during a session,
        possibly even on a per-packet basis. A typical example can be a speech
        codec that makes use of <xref target="RFC3389">Comfort Noise</xref>
        and/or <xref target="RFC4733">DTMF</xref> formats. In those cases,
        such "related" formats MUST NOT be listed explicitly in the attribute
        parameters, since they are not strictly simulcast streams of the media
        source, but rather a specific way of generating the RTP stream of a
        single simulcast stream with varying RTP payload type. Instead, only a
        single simulcast stream identification MUST be used per simulcast
        stream or alternative simulcast format (if there are such) in the SDP.
        The used simulcast stream identification SHOULD be the codec format
        most relevant to the media description, if possible to identify, for
        example the audio codec rather than the DTMF. What codec format to
        choose in the case of switching between multiple equally "important"
        formats is left open, but it is assumed that in the presence of such
        strong relation it does not matter which is chosen.</t>

        <t>If <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-stream-pause">RTP stream
        pause/resume</xref> is supported, the optional "paused=" parameter MAY
        be used in conjunction with "rid" simulcast stream identification to
        specify that a certain simulcast stream is initially paused already
        from start of the RTP session. In this case, support for RTP stream
        pause/resume MUST also be included under the same "m="-line listing
        "a=simulcast". Initially paused simulcast streams MUST NOT be used
        with "pt" identification. Initially paused simulcast streams are
        resumed as described by the RTP pause/resume specification.</t>

        <t>An initially paused simulcast stream in "send" direction MUST be
        considered equivalent to an unsolicited locally paused stream, and be
        handled accordingly.</t>

        <t>An initially paused simulcast stream in "recv" direction SHOULD
        cause the remote RTP sender to put the stream as unsolicited locally
        paused, unless there are other RTP stream receivers that do not mark
        the simulcast stream as initially paused. The reason to require an
        initially paused "recv" stream to be considered locally paused by the
        remote RTP sender, instead of making it equivalent to implicitly
        sending a pause request, is because the pausing RTP sender cannot know
        which SSRC owns the restriction when TMMBR/TMMBN are used for
        pause/resume signaling since the RTP receiver's SSRC in send direction
        is not known yet.</t>

        <t>Use of the <xref target="RFC2198">redundant audio data</xref>
        format could be seen as a form of simulcast for loss protection
        purposes, but is not considered conflicting with the mechanisms
        described in this memo and MAY therefore be used as any other format.
        In this case the "red" format, rather than the carried formats, SHOULD
        be the one to list as a simulcast stream on the "a=simulcast"
        line.</t>

          separate media sources in each direction, where each media source is
          simulcast-enabled in the send direction. Fred's client is restricted
          to a single media source per media description.</t>

          <t>The first two simulcast streams for the first media source use
          different codecs, <xref target="RFC6190">H264-SVC</xref> and <xref
          target="RFC6184">H264</xref>. These two simulcast streams also have
          a temporal dependency. Two different video codecs, <xref

          alternatives for the third simulcast stream for the first media
          source. RID is used as simulcast stream identification, reducing the
          number of media formats needed. Only the highest fidelity simulcast
          stream are sent from start, the lower fidelity streams being

          is used as simulcast stream identification. Also here, all but the

          <t>Fred's client is also using BUNDLE to send all RTP streams from
          all media descriptions in the same RTP session on a single media
          transport. Although using many different simulcast streams in this
          example, use of RID as simulcast stream identification enables use
          of a low number of RTP payload types. Note that the use of both
          BUNDLE and RID recommends using the <xref target="RFC5285">RTP

    <section anchor="sec-network-aspects" title="Network Aspects">
      <t>Simulcast is in this memo defined as the act of sending multiple
      alternative encoded streams of the same underlying media source. When
      transmitting multiple independent streams that originate from the same
      source, it could potentially be done in several different ways using
      RTP. A general discussion on considerations for use of the different RTP
      multiplexing alternatives can be found in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-multiplex-guidelines">Guidelines for
      Multiplexing in RTP</xref>. Discussion and clarification on how to
      handle multiple streams in an RTP session can be found in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream"/>.</t>

      <t>The network aspects that are relevant for simulcast are:<list
          style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Quality of Service:">When using simulcast it might be
          of interest to prioritize a particular simulcast stream, rather than
          applying equal treatment to all streams. For example, lower bit-rate
          streams may be prioritized over higher bit-rate streams to minimize
          congestion or packet losses in the low bit-rate streams. Thus, there
          is a benefit to use a simulcast solution that supports QoS as good
          as possible.</t>

          <t hangText="NAT/FW Traversal:">Using multiple RTP sessions incurs
          more cost for NAT/FW traversal unless they can re-use the same

    <section anchor="sec-limitation" title="Limitations">
      <t>The chosen approach has a few limitations that are described in this
      section. Some relate to the use of a single RTP session for all
      simulcast formats of a media source, while others relate to the two
      different simulcast stream identification methods.</t>

      <section title="Single RTP Session">
        <t>The limitations in this section come from sending all simulcast
        streams related to a media source under the same SDP media
        description, which also means they are sent in the same RTP
        session.</t>

        <t>It is not possible to use different simulcast streams on different
        transports, limiting the possibilities to apply different QoS to
        different simulcast streams. When using unicast, QoS mechanisms based
        on individual packet marking are feasible, since they do not require
        separation of simulcast streams into different RTP sessions to apply
        different QoS.</t>

        <t>It is not possible to separate different simulcast streams into
        different multicast groups to allow a multicast receiver to pick the
        stream it wants, rather than receive all of them. In this case, the
        only reasonable implementation is to use different RTP sessions for
        each multicast group so that reporting and other RTCP functions
        operate as intended.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SDP Format Identification">
        <t>The limitations in this section come from and thus apply only when
        using SDP format (RTP payload type) as simulcast stream identification
        method.</t>

        <t>The available RTP payload type number space may not be sufficient
        when many different media formats and/or simulcast streams are used in
        the SDP. This can be particularly prominent when BUNDLE is used, and
        for any technology that adds to the number of required RTP payload
        types in a multiplicative way, such as for example adding <xref
        target="RFC4588">RTP retransmission</xref> and <xref
        target="RFC5109">Forward Error Correction</xref>.</t>

        <t>Only existing SDP attributes and parameters can be used to define
        codec configuration for a simulcast format. Any codec that does not
        define a sufficient set of codec parameters in "a=fmtp", or can make
        use of other SDP attributes, may not be capable of expressing the
        desired <xref target="sec-diverse-receivers">simulcast format
        dimensions</xref> with necessary precision, or not at all. One example
        of this is the ability to separate simulcast formats by bandwidth for
        codecs lacking a codec-specific bandwidth parameter, since the SDP
        "b="-line covers all RTP payload types listed on an "m="-line.</t>

        <t>When using FEC according to <xref target="RFC5109"/> in a single
        RTP session, there is no defined way to express the relation between
        the simulcast stream and the FEC stream protecting it.</t>

        <t>A simulcast stream signaled as initially paused is not possible to
        resume by a remote peer, because it cannot know which target SSRC to
        use in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-stream-pause">RESUME
        message</xref>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="RID Identification">
        <t>The limitations in this section come from and thus apply only when
        using RID as simulcast stream identification method.</t>

        <t>Use of the additional "a=rid"-line in SDP and the corresponding RID
        RTCP SDES item and RTP header extension requires some additional
        implementation complexity, and incurs some extra bandwidth cost to
        carry the RID RTCP SDES item and RTP header extension.</t>

    <section anchor="sec-iana" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document requests to register a new SDP attribute,
      simulcast.</t>

      <t>Formal registrations to be written.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The simulcast capability, configuration attributes and parameters are
      vulnerable to attacks in signaling.</t>

      <t>A false inclusion of the "a=simulcast" attribute may result in
      simultaneous transmission of multiple RTP streams that would otherwise
      not be generated. The impact is limited by the media description joint
      bandwidth, shared by all simulcast streams irrespective of their number.
      There may however be a large number of unwanted RTP streams that will
      impact the share of bandwidth allocated for the originally wanted RTP
      stream.</t>

      <t>A hostile removal of the "a=simulcast" attribute will result in
      simulcast not being used.</t>

      <t>Neither of the above will likely have any major consequences and can
      be mitigated by signaling that is at least integrity and source
      authenticated to prevent an attacker to change it.</t>
